# NZ Forager 
My final project at Dev Academy, with a focus on developing a full stack web application using redux, react, node.js, SQLlite, and cloud photo storage.

The web application has an easy and minimal interface, for quick access to assist in identifying plants. This makes the prospect of plant identification fun and accessible to people new to the subject.


To do:
- JWT-Auth
- Display user cloud photo uploads in front end 
- Finish the add plant function
- Add an interactive location map
- Tags pages for uses (medicinal, edible, natural dyes, etc)
- Recipes for foods, natural dyes
